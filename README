./words_bdd words bdd.dot

Reads in a list of words from the file words. 

Treats each word as a null terminated sequence of ascii chars / bits.

Builds a BDD representing all words in the file.

Outputs some stats and a dot (graphviz) representation of the bdd to bdd.dot
file.

Compiling:

    Requires cudd to be installed.

    Edit CMakeLists to reflect cudd installation.

    Then (in source dir):

        cmake .
        make
