A crossword solver implemented using BDDs.

Running

    ./words_bdd -h

gives the options.


---------------
Getting started
---------------

    ./words_bdd -w words -ob words.bdd
    ./words_bdd -ib words.bdd -p "h*ll*"

The first command reads from the file "words" which should contain a list of
words in ascii format.  A BDD representing the word file is then written to
words.bdd.  (Can take some time for large word files.)

Suggested word file: /usr/share/dict/words...

The second command reads in the created bdd (from words.bdd), and looks for all
words matching the pattern "h*ll*" (where * is (non-empty) wildcard).

------------------------------------
Solving Crosswords -- Diagram Format
------------------------------------

Write a crossword file in the following format:

    h*ll*
     a  r
    a*e c
        h
        *
        d

That is, a diagramatical layout with * for unknowns.

If your crossword file is test.cwd, run

    ./words_bdd -ib words.bdd -cwd test.cwd

where words.bdd is created as above.

It will print out all solutions.  For our example:

    Crossword read:

    h*ll*
     a  r
    a*e c
        h
        *
        d

    Found solutions!

    hello
     a  r
    ate c
        h
        i
        d


    hello
     a  r
    are c
        h
        i
        d



--------------------------------
Solving Crosswords -- Raw Format
--------------------------------

Write a crossword file in the following format (no blank lines):

    A 0 0 h*ll*
    D 1 0 *a*
    A 0 2 a*e
    D 4 0 *rch*d

That is

    <dir> <x start> <y start> <pattern>

where 

    <dir> is A if the clue is across, D if down.
    <x start> is the x position (from 0) of the first square
    <y start> is the y position (from 0) of the first square
    <pattern> is the word pattern, using * for unknown.

If your crossword file is test.rcw, run

    ./words_bdd -ib words.bdd -rcw test.cw

where words.bdd is created as above.

It will print out all solutions.  For our example:

    Crossword read:

    A 0 0 h*ll*
    D 1 0 *a*
    A 0 2 a*e
    D 4 0 *rch*d

    Found solutions!

    hello
     a  r
    ate c
        h
        i
        d


    hello
     a  r
    are c
        h
        i
        d

Notes
-----

When using -d to output a dot file, to render the dot file, i suggest using sfdp
from graphviz (it's the filter for large diagrams).

The file en.png is a rendering of my /usr/share/dict/words...

Compiling:

    Requires cudd bdd library (v 2.4.2) to be installed.

    Edit CMakeLists link_directories and include_directories to reflect cudd
    installation.

    Then (in source dir):

        cmake .
        make
