    ./words_bdd words bdd.dot 

reads in a list of words from the file words (e.g. /usr/share/dict/words). 

Treats each word as a null terminated sequence of ascii chars / bits.

Builds a BDD representing all words in the file.

Outputs some stats and a dot (graphviz) representation of the bdd to bdd.dot
file.

To render the dot file, i suggest using sfdp from graphviz (it's the filter for
large diagrams...)

Compiling:

    Requires cudd bdd library (v 2.4.2) to be installed.

    Edit CMakeLists link_directories and include_directories to reflect cudd
    installation.

    Then (in source dir):

        cmake .
        make
